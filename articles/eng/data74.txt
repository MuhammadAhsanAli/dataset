instagram reinvents itself with clean new design and icon in latest update
instagram's new icon. (instagram) five and a half years after its inception, instagram is finally getting the redesign it deserves.today, the facebook-owned social network announced on its blog that the instagram brand will have a new look, from the top down. the company hinted the new changes two weeks ago, when it confirmed it was testing a new look.more from digital trends:instagram testing new business profiles that let you create your personal brandmusic junkie? here are 22 of our favorite apps for consuming and creating tunesjazz up dull instagram photos with adobe post, no design skills requirednot only has instagram and its suite of accompanying apps received new icons, but the design of the app itself has gotten a monochromatic makeover.starting with the new app icon, instagram took inspiration from its iconic polaroid-inspired icon, but brought it into the world of flat design with a simple white outline and colorful gradient background.accompanying the main instagram app are redesigned icons for its layout, boomerang, and hyperlapse apps. cleverly, instagram inverted the white/gradient scheme to differentiate its accompanying apps from the main app.past the icon is where the magic really happens though. inside both the ios and android app, instagram has simplified the interface.specifically, they've eliminated the blue header that was previously a part of instagram branding and opted for a pure black-and-white design with a few color accents for notifications and "likes."the idea is that this new color scheme and accompanying layout will better put the focus on the photos and videos shared within the app.some might call it bland, but for an app that lives on the visuals of its users, it's a smart move. artists want their work to be displayed on a blank canvas. any unnecessary colors or design elements detracts from the viewing experience and this new layout seems to put the interface right where it should be: behind the scenes.
