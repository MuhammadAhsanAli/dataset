one photo not enough instagram now lets you post 10
(instagram)planning to post multiple photos or videos on instagram? you can now combine up to 10 of them into a single post, filling your friends' feeds with a new level of storytelling.the update, rolling out to ios and android with version 10.9 of the instagram app, lets you select up to 10 photos or videos from your phone's library to create a post. the result is almost identical to the photos or videos you're used to seeing in your instagram feed, except for a row of tiny dots at the bottom center of the image or clip.those dots indicate to your friends that they should swipe to view the rest of your photos or videosâ€”a recipe for chocolate chip cookies, perhaps, or maybe before and after shots of your thanksgiving dinner table.as you'd expect, these new posts stuffed with multiple shots can be edited with the numerous filters for which instagram is known. you can tap a filter at the bottom of the screen to apply it to every photo and video you've selected, or tap individual photos or videos to edit them and add filters individually. t-mobile's next speed boost requires new phonesfandango eyes the future of movie goingnasa finds 7 new earth-sized planets get a 55-inch samsung 4k uhd tv for $1,500
