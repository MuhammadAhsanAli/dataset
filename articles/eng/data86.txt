file photo. (reuters/kacper pempel)twitter might be known for its stringent 140-character limit to its tweets, but it has now loosened those guidelines for direct messages. the social media site announced wednesday that the 140-character limit to direct messages has been lifted.“you can now chat on (and on) in a single direct message, and likely still have some characters left over,” twitter wrote on its company blog.the whole point of the public tweets is to keep them short, sweet, and in-the-moment. that isn’t true for the site’s direct message feature. when it comes to the private messages, the site asserted that this new change gives users the opportunity to better “spark a conversation about what’s happening in your world.”this comes after other changes that twitter has made to its private messaging platform. in january, the company announced group direct messages and made some other changes in april, including a setting that allowed users to receive messages from anyone, even if they don’t follow them.
