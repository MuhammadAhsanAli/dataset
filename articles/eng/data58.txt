facebook inc. might be coming to a bigger small screen.the social network is developing a video-centric app for television set-top boxes, including apple inc.’s apple tv, people familiar with the matter said, giving it a home for video content—as well as a new vehicle for video advertising.the app is one of several facebook projects aimed at making it a “video-first” company that can compete for television ad dollars. the social giant has been marketing its live-streaming capabilities, testing a new video ad product and integrating more videos into instagram, its photo-sharing app.facebook is also in discussions with media companies to license long-form, tv-quality programming, people familiar with the situation said. a set-top box app would be a natural way to distribute that “premium” content and make it accessible on tv sets.facebook is already the second-biggest player in digital advertising, after alphabet inc.’s google. but the social-media giant said last november that its main source of revenue, the news feed, was running out of room for more ads.
