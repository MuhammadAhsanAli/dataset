(reuters/thomas hodel)mark zuckerberg really wants facebook to have an presence in china, but it doesn't matter what he tries the social network remains banned there. he' s learned to speak mandarin, gone jogging across beijing's tiananmen square, met with their censorship chief, promoted president xi jinping's book, and even created a censorship tool for the country, but to no avail.now it seems, zuckerberg is trying a completely different tactic: secretly entering china by anonymously releasing an app there.as the new york times reports, the app in question is called colorful balloons and it "shares the look, function and feel" of photo-sharing app facebook moments. but while it feels like a facebook app, there is absolutely no hint of facebook when using it. akasa launches raspberry pi case with thermal kitsonicspy android spyware records audio, snoops on call logselon musk's openai bot beats pro dota 2 playerhow to build a pc with the amd threadripper chip
